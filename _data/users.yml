          description: "Afonso as a strong young man, decided not to play the role of the obedient son and defied his mother. In fact, his strength gave birth to the legend that the sword he used in the many battles he engaged was so heavy that only five men could handle it. Influenced by his tutor Egas Moniz, the young Afonso grew a huge admiration for his father and his ideas, therefore fought against his mother and the Castile armies in the Battle of São Mamede in order to take the power in his hands. And he succeeded!"

          description: "The next step towards independence was to turn the Pope into an ally in order to get the Papal bull to formalize the question. To do so, Afonso Henriques fought the Moors and, following his father’s footprints, conquered new territories. The Battle of Ourique was decisive to this goal as his troops defeated the better equipped and large numbered Moorish army. Some say that this win was a true miracle."

          description: "After Teresa's death in 1131, Afonso VII of León and Castille proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin. On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal or Prince of the Portuguese, an act informally allowed by Afonso VII, as it was thought to be Afonso Henriques's right by blood, as one of two grandsons of the Emperor of Hispania."

          description: Egas Moniz de Ribadouro, possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of Ribadouro. Yet, contemporary documents, namely from the chancery of Afonso in his early years as count of Portucale, indicate that the most likely tutor of Afonso Henriques was Egas Moniz's oldest brother, Ermígio Moniz, who, besides being the senior brother within the family of Ribadouro, became the "dapifer" and "majordomus" of Afonso I from 1128 until his death in 1135, which indicates his closer proximity to the prince

          description: Fighting and Swords. It was too big to be called a sword. Massive, thick, heavy, and far too rough. Indeed, it was a heap of raw iron. There are mythical stories that it took 5 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge.
